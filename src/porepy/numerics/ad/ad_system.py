class ADSystem:
    """Represents a system of equations, modelled by AD variables and equations in AD form.

    This class provides functionalities to create and manage primary and secondary variables,
    as well as managing equations in AD operator form.

    It further provides functions to assemble subsystems, using subsets of equations and
    primary variables.
    Secondary variables are not considered for creating e.g., the Jacobian and only their
    values are used (similar to parameters).

    Notes:
        As of now, the system matrix (Jacobian) is assembled with respect to ALL variables
        (including secondary ones) and then the columns belonging to primary variables are
        sliced out and returned. This can be optimized with minor changes to the AD operator
        class and its recursive forward AD mode.

        This class also lacks optimization methods reducing the band width of the resulting
        Jacobian. This will be added in the future.

        Internally, this class uses a :class:`porepy.DofManager` until further notice.

    Parameters:
        mdg: mixed-dimensional grid representing the whole computational domain.
        var_categories (optional): an :class:`Enum` object containing categories for variables,
            defined by the user/modeler. They can later be used to assign categories to created
            variables and assemble respective subsystems.

        The method is intended for use in splitting algorithms. Matrix blocks not
        included will simply be sliced out.

        Notes:
            The ordering of columns in the returned system are defined by the global DOF order
            provided by the DofManager. The rows are of the same order as equations were added
            to this system.

            If a combination of variables and grids is chosen, s.t. the variables were **not**
            defined on those grids, the resulting matrix is a zero matrix which **does not**
            appear as a block in the complete assembly using :meth:`assemble`,
            because the methods assemble by default only columns belonging to well-defined dofs
            , i.e. dofs for which the the grid-var combo was properly defined.
            The matrix is of shape ``num_equations x 0``. (see project_to of DofManager)
            This means that this method can create (possibly empty ) blocks which are **not**
            in the global system. TODO ask IS and EK if an error should be raised instead.
            This is connected with the TODO in project_to of the DofManager
            (0 projection or error or projection with adequate size but still 0)

        Parameters:
            equations (optional): a subset of equation names to which the subsystem should be
                restricted.
                If not provided (None), all equations known to this manager will be included.
            variables (optional): names of variables to which the subsystem should be
                restricted. If not provided (None), all variables will be included.
            grid_rows (optional): grids or mortar grids which should be kept in the row-wise
                sense, i.e. subsystems on specified domains.
                If not provided (None), all involved grids and mortar grids will be included.
            grid_columns (optional): grids or mortar grids for which the column-wise
                contribution to each equation should be kept. This is a narrowing down of the
                restriction imposed by ``variables``.
                If not provided (None), all grids and mortar grids will be included.
            state (optional): State vector to assemble from. By default the stored ITERATE or
                STATE are used, in that order.

        Returns:
            spmatrix: (Part of the) Jacobian matrix corresponding to the targeted variable
                state, for the specified equations and columns.
            ndarray: Residual vector corresponding to the targeted variable state,

            [A_pp, A_ps  [x_p   = [b_p
             A_sp, A_ss]  x_s]     b_s]

        Where subscripts p and s define primary and secondary quantities. The Schur
        complement system is then given by

            (A_pp - A_ps * inv(A_ss) * A_sp) * x_p = b_p - A_ps * inv(A_ss) * b_s.

        The Schur complement is well-defined only if the inverse of A_ss exists,
        and the efficiency of the approach assumes that an efficient inverter for
        A_ss can be found. The user must ensure both requirements are fulfilled.
        The simplest option is a lambda function on the form:

        .. code:: Python

            inverter = lambda A: sps.csr_matrix(np.linalg.inv(A.A))

        (used by default) but depending on A (size and sparsity pattern),

        The method can be used e.g. for splitting between primary and secondary variables,
        where the latter can be efficiently eliminated (for instance, they contain no
        spatial derivatives).

        Parameters:
            primary_equations: equations to be assembled, representing the row-block A_pp.
                Should have length > 0.

                Should have length > 0.
            inverter (optional): callable object to compute the inverse of the matrix A_ss.
