This module contains an implementation of Sneddon's crack pressurization problem.
The problem consists of a one-dimensional crack of length :math:`2h` fully embedded in
the center of a host rock, forming an angle :math:`theta` with the horizontal axis.

A pressure :maht:`P` is exherted, equally, at both sides of the interior
faces of the crack, causing a relative normal displacement :math:`[\mathbf{u}]_n` of
the crack. Shear forces are zero.

Sneddon's [1] found an exact solution for the relative displacement as a function of
the :math:`P`, :
