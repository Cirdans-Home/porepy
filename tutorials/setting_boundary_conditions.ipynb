    "In this tutorial we will visit how to set boundary conditions for different model problems in PorePy.\n",
    "In general, the setup is roughly as follows:\n",
    "* Boundary condition type (Neumann or Dirichlet) is set by one method\n",
    "* Boundary condition values are set through one or more methods\n",
    "\n",
    "Internally in the code there are Neumann and Dirichlet filters being assigned according to the user's input in the boundary condition type method.\n",
    "These filters make sure that only values set by a Dirichlet-method is assigned to Dirichlet boundaries, and similar for the Neumann case. For explaining this more thoroughly we will present some examples.\n"
