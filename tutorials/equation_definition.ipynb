    "# Setting up equations using algorithmic differentiation \n",
    "This tutorial is meant as an introduction to the PorePy framework for defining and working with (non-linear) equations, using the mixed-dimensional flow problem as an example. For an introduction to basic concepts of algorithmic differentiation, please refer to the dedicated [automatic differentiation tutorial](https://github.com/pmgbergen/porepy/blob/develop/tutorials/automatic_differentiation.ipynb). \n",
    "Note that for several much used problems, PorePy provides `Model` classes to solve mixed-dimensional PDEs. These classes use the AD functionality as described herein. A less technical explanation of how to solve the present mixed-dimensional problem is provided in the [incompressible flow tutorial](https://github.com/pmgbergen/porepy/blob/develop/tutorials/incompressible_flow_model.ipynb), which also details the equations. Herein, we provide more detailed explanations and descriptions of the design of the AD objects."

    "## Framework components\n",
    "The framework consists of four types of classes:\n",
    "1. Variables. These carry the numerical state of the primary variables, and also values at previous time steps and iteration states.\n",
    "2. Grid-dependent operators are defined on one or multiple subdomain grids. Examples are:\n",
    "    * divergence and trace operators\n",
    "    * boundary conditions\n",
    "    * parameter arrays and matrices\n",
    "    * projections between interfaces and subdomain grids\n",
    "    * projections between sets of subdomains and subsets.\n",
    "3. Discretization objects. These are essentially shells around standard PorePy discretization methods. Their purpose is to provide access to the discretization matrices computed by those methods in a form consistent with the AD framework.\n",
    "4. Classes for book-keeping, notably degree-of-freedom handling and the relation between equations/variables and the underlying mixed-dimensional grid.\n",
    "\n",
    "Solving (partial differential) equations on a mixed-dimensional grid requires defining the above objects, combining them into equations and solving the ensuing equation system. \n",

    "As a test case, we define a mixed-dimensional grid, which we for simplicity let be Cartesian"
